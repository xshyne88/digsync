* Social Media
** Users can see all Groups, make groups either clickable to go to a group display page
** Users can see Group Display page and make a request to join a group
** Group Admins see all pending Group Requests and can accept them
** Users inside of a Group can see other members in a group
** Users can send private messages and see messages that they have sent and received from other users (display for that)
** Users can send messages to a group and can see other previously sent messages
* Authentication
** figure out how we are going to work the frontend so we can decide where to show sign in/up
** Oauth2 flows, (google facebook) probably separate from liveviews and will be on the home page somewhere
** Admin Dashboard (Ash Framework has built in support need to implement)
** We need to verify that our Magic Links work and sign people in via email
* Event Scheduling
** frontend calendar showing? time showing? figure out how users can input datetimes whats best way to do that
** figure out how to store time availability as datetimes for users
** queries on the backend for filtering by availability in postgres
** figure out how to seed events, so that we have data to play with for filtering
** maybe do some research on how other apps accomplish event scheduling
* Locations
** Ash-geo queries for st_within
** normalize our addresses to actually have fields, city state zip road name etc instead of just a string
** try a ton of different addresses on our http endpoint to see if it actually works
** Have events be assignable to a location (via a relationship)
